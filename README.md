## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NishdaS/weather-forecast-ml.git
   cd weather-forecast-ml

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended)

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

3. Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the backend server
   python back-end/app.py

5. Open the frontend
   Open front-end/index.html in your browser or use Live Server in VS Code.
